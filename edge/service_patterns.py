"""Vehicle Service Lifecycle & Employee Performance Evaluation Engine.

Manages the complete lifecycle of a vehicle in the service bay:
1. ARRIVAL: Car enters bay, identified & job opened.
2. IN_SERVICE: Active wrench time, pose tracking, multi-technician logging.
3. DEPARTURE: Employee drives car out of bay, stopping the timer.
4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: Instant performance grading (efficiency %, focus score, breakdown).
5. KNOWLEDGE BASE: Stores repair patterns and standard service benchmarks from training videos/transcripts.
