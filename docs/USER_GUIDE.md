## 1. System Overview & Core Capabilities

**Inbound Surveillance** transforms your standard security cameras and webcams into proactive AI edge agents. Unlike passive CCTV that only records video, Inbound actively tracks vehicle bay occupancy, calculates technician wrench-time, records automated Face ID attendance, and sends instant Telegram photo proofs during safety breaches.

- **Local Edge Processing:** All video analysis runs 100% locally on your venue station. Video feeds never upload to external public clouds.
- **Two Interfaces Available:** Use the **Web Operations Console** in any browser (`http://localhost:5173/dashboard.html`) or launch the standalone **Native Desktop App**.

## 2. Navigating the Live View Console

The **Live View** is your day-to-day command center. It shows real-time camera video streams, active telemetry, and intelligent bay overlays:
- **Multi-Camera Grid:** Displays all active cameras. Click any tile to inspect it in full screen.
- **Top Telemetry Banner:** Displays *Ingest FPS* (camera delivery speed), *Infer Latency* (AI processing speed, typically 20–45ms), and resolution.
- **Audio Chimes (SOUND ON / MUTE):** Click the sound pill in the header to enable audio chimes whenever a car enters a service bay.
- **Shop Operating Hours:** Automatically marks the venue as **SHOP OPEN** during business hours (e.g. 08:00–18:00) and switches to **AFTER HOURS** mode (which triggers high-priority trespass alerts).

## 3. Understanding Service Bay Overlays & Colors

| Border Color | Status Name | Detection Meaning | Operational Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vibrant Green** | **Active Labor** | Vehicle present and technician actively detected working (wrench pose). | Accumulates productive wrench-time on technician scorecards. |
| **Warm Amber** | **Bay Idle** | Vehicle present, but no active tool movement detected for >120 seconds. | Increments idle timer; alerts manager to parts waiting or downtime. |
| **Subtle Gray** | **Available / Empty** | No vehicle or technician detected inside the service bay boundary. | Flags bay as open for immediate customer intake. |

## 4. Setting Up Service Bays & ROIs (Drag-and-Drop)

To position service bays over your vehicle lifts or alignment racks:
1. Open **Live View** and locate your target camera feed.
2. Click the **Settings Cog** or right-click any existing bay to open the **Bay Context Menu**.
3. Select **Edit ROI** to activate interactive bounding handles. Drag the corners to frame your vehicle bay.
4. Assign a descriptive name (e.g. *Lift Bay 1*, *Tire Station*) and click **Save**.

## 5. Connecting Cameras & Video Sources

Inbound Surveillance supports real-time IP cameras, mobile phone cameras, USB webcams, and pre-recorded video files. Click **Add Camera** in the sidebar or setup modal to connect a video source:

| Source Type | Protocol | Connection URL Example / Steps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IP Camera (RTSP)**<br/>Hikvision, Dahua, Axis | `rtsp` | `rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.50:554/h264Preview_01_main`<br/>*Use camera's local IP address, RTSP port 554, and ONVIF/RTSP credentials.* |
| **Pre-Recorded Video**<br/>Uploaded MP4/AVI file | `video` | Select **Local Video File**, click **Upload Video**, and choose your file.<br/>*The engine loops the video locally for offline testing, demos, and forensics.* |
| **Android Phone**<br/>Using *IP Webcam* app | `phone` | `http://192.168.1.85:8080/video`<br/>*Ensure phone is on the same Wi-Fi. Start server in the app and enter the video URL.* |
| **USB Webcam**<br/>Logitech / PC Camera | `webcam` | Enter device index `0` (or `1` for secondary webcam, `/dev/video0` on Linux).<br/>*Great for front-desk enrollment and test setups.* |
| **One-Click Auto Scan**<br/>ONVIF & Tapo Discovery | `onvif` / `tapo` | Click **Scan Network**. The system automatically detects compatible ONVIF and Tapo cameras on your subnet. Click **Connect** to apply. |

### How to Upload & Analyze Pre-Recorded Video Files
If you want to test the system or analyze pre-recorded incident footage without a live camera:
1. Click **Add Camera** in the sidebar or open **Settings → Source**.
2. Set **Protocol** to **Local Video File (MP4/AVI)**.
3. Click **Upload Video** and select your file (e.g., `garage_shift_morning.mp4`).
4. The system automatically uploads the file to the local edge directory (`edge/videos/`) and loops playback seamlessly through the AI pose and bay tracking pipeline.
5. Enter a camera label (e.g., *Shift Review - Bay 1*) and click **Connect & Save**.

### Dual-Stream Best Practice (Pro Tip for Commercial Garages)
To get 25+ FPS AI detection without overloading your CPU, configure dual streams in `config.yaml`:
- **Substream (`source:`):** Set to 640x360 or 1280x720 resolution @ 15 FPS. Used for continuous, high-speed AI inference.
- **Mainstream (`main_source:`):** Set to 1080p or 4K resolution. Queried only when an alert fires to capture crisp photographic evidence.

## 6. Connecting Your Telegram Alerts (1-Click Pairing)

Inbound Surveillance comes with an official pre-configured Telegram Bot. You do **not** need to create a bot or paste API tokens. The software automatically links your Telegram account and Chat ID directly to your signed-in profile with one click:

| Step | Action | Exact Instructions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Sign In** | Log in to your venue account on the Inbound Surveillance web console or desktop application so the bot knows which account to pair. |
| **2** | **Click Connect** | Navigate to **Settings → Integrations** (or open the **Telegram Panel** on the right sidebar) and click the green **Connect Telegram** button. |
| **3** | **Tap Start** | The official Inbound Surveillance bot opens automatically in your Telegram app. Tap **Start** (or send `/start`). Your unique pairing token is verified instantly. |
| **4** | **Auto-Linked** | Your Chat ID is automatically saved to your software account. The badge switches to **Linked**, activating instant incident photo dispatches and daily scorecards. |
| **5** | **Send Test** | Click **Capture & Send Test** (or **Submit Ticket**) in the panel to receive an immediate live photo proof on your smartphone and confirm delivery. |

## 7. Quick Troubleshooting Matrix

| Issue / Symptom | Probable Cause | Quick Fix (1 Minute) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Black screen or 'Connecting…'** | Camera IP changed or wrong password. | Verify camera IP in router DHCP table. Test stream URL in VLC player. |
| **Telegram alerts not sending** | Telegram account not yet linked. | Open **Settings → Integrations**, click **Connect Telegram**, and tap **Start** in the Telegram app. |
| **Frame rate drops below 10 FPS** | Stream resolution too high for CPU. | Switch camera to 720p or 360p substream. In `config.yaml` set `detect_fps: 15`. |
| **Technician marked 'Idle' under car** | Worker occluded longer than grace limit. | Increase `under_car_grace_seconds: 45` in `config.yaml` to maintain working state. |
| **Face ID identifies staff as 'Customer'** | Enrolled photo has poor lighting/angle. | Upload 2 fresh, front-facing photos in good lighting via **Identity → Enroll Staff**. |
